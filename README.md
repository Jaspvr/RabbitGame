# Rabbit Game
An original game I made using the pygame library

# Video Demo: https://youtu.be/19lF7M3srFo
This game is incomplete as I hope to eventually create multiple waves/levels of rabbits, and have the rabbits do damage to the balloon

To run the game for yourself, clone the repository, and run `Basics.py`
